Philosophy
----------

The Palimpsest License embodies:

- **Attribution**: Credit where credit is due
- **Freedom**: Permissive like MIT, but encourages sharing
- **Solidarity**: Economic cooperation over extraction
- **Community**: Collective improvement benefits all
- **Pragmatism**: Compatible with existing licenses
- **Reversibility**: Easy to switch to other licenses if needed

Name Origin
-----------

A palimpsest is a manuscript where the original text has been scraped off
and overwritten, yet traces remain visible. Like a palimpsest, software
evolves through layers of contribution, each building on what came before.

The Palimpsest License honors this layered history while allowing new
writing to emerge.
